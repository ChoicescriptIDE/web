## Acknowledgements

First and foremost, we would like to thank Choice of Games LLC, consisting of Jason Stevan Hill, Adam Morse, ChoiceScript's creator, Dan Fabulich, and the rest of their ever growing team.
Thank you for providing us with a fresh and ever increasing (and improving) selection of high quality multiple choice games. Thank you for being champions of equality and feminism... and last, but certainly not least, thank you for creating
ChoiceScript, and allowing and supporting the growth of such a very special community. Thank you for letting us all be such a big part of what you do.

We would also like to thank that very same community, the forum-goers, the game-players and even those of you who haven't joined us yet. Without you, the fans (and potential fans), there would be no games, there would be no ChoiceScript. There would be no ChoiceScript IDE. Thank you to all, past, present and future supporters, pioneers of all that we do and stand for. It has, and will continue to be, our pleasure to be a part of it all.

CJW would also like to thank T, A and D - and anyone else who's had to put up with my random rants and musings about the IDE over the years.

> // any thanks from you guys?

Of course, no thank you list could ever be complete without that of the 'CSIDE Team', the only fitting name.
Three years is a very long time to work alone on a side project of this magnitude. Without pay, without a clear goal, and with no finish line in sight.
Between life, work and my studies, it would have been very easy to give up on this project, way back before it had barely even began, to leave it as that simple textbox on a website that you could paste some ChoiceScript code into.
From the very beginning, from a featureless bug ridden mess to a featureful (and slightly less) buggy mess, they saw the potential in this idea and carried it with me through the years. Through productive times and quiet times, hard times and easy times, the fun and the dull. If I were to be the anvil, the forge that made CSIDE - these guys are the hammer. This is as much their achievement as it is mine.

In no particular order, by their Choice of Games forum handles:

  - Vendetta
  - Fiogan
  - Nocturnal_Stillness
  - fantom
  - LordIrish
  - Shockbolt

Thank you for everything.

To all the other beta-testers, who weren't with us all the way, you know who you are, and you also have our heartfelt thanks, for all the parts you played - be they big or small.

> // code libraries, resources etc

There really isn't a single person, organisation, resource or entity listed on this page that the CSIDE, in its current form, could exist without. Thank you one and all, it really wouldn't be even half of the program it is today without every last one of you. We hope you enjoy using CSIDE just as much as we did creating it.

Happy scripting,

- The CSIDE Team

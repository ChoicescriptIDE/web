## Adding Scenes

By convention all ChoiceScript games require two compulsory scenes, or 'vignettes'. These are the 'startup' file and the 'choicescript_stats' file. CSIDE will create these two standard scenes for you automatically whenever you create a brand new project, but thereafter it's entirely up to you when to add more scenes, and how many.


### How to Add Scenes

To add a brand new scene to a project, click the '+' icon  on that project's header bar. Doing so will create, open (and immediately save, to that project's own folder) a new, 'Untitled' scene file.

You can rename an ordinary scene file at any time by double-clicking it. If already selected - e.g. one you've just created - then a single click will suffice to enable renaming. You cannot however rename the two compulsory ChoiceScript files ('startup' and 'choicescript_stats').


### Scene Limitations & Structure

There is no hard technical limit on the number of scenes you can create, but try to find a good balance. If this is your first foray into developing ChoiceScript games there are a couple of old but very useful articles which might give you an idea on how to start thinking about game structure:

CSIDE can create brand new blank Projects or import them from your existing Scene files. There's no magic here. We use the word import because it makes more sense in terms of running or testing complete games and Projects, but really all CSIDE does is open your indivudal .txt (Scene) files for modification, just like any other text editor.


### Creating a New Project

To create a brand new project, click the button with a '+' icon alongside the 'Scenes & Projects' header near the top-left of the interface. 

You will be prompted to enter a name for the new project. You are free to call it what you like but it's probably a good idea to use something similar to what you intend to call your actual game. If the name is valid and the folder successfully created, a confirmation message will pop up displaying the full directory path of your project. It will look something like this (by default):

> Windows - C:\Users\Username\Documents\ChoiceScript Projects\My Project Name

> Mac - /Users/Username/Choicescript Projects/My Project Name

A new Project will be created with the two compulsory files required for every Choice Game - 'startup' and 'choicescript_stats' - already listed and ready for immediate use. Additional Scene files can then be added to the new Project as needed.


### Importing an Existing Project

If you already have a ChoiceScript game in development and would like to continue working on this within CSIDE, then importing it couldn't be easier.

For the most part projects are handled automatically within CSIDE. All you need to do is click the button with a folder icon alongside the Scenes & Projects header and select which actual .txt (scene) game files you wish to open. CSIDE will open those files and assign them to (in essence, create) a new CSIDE Project for you.

Note that the import procedure does not in any way copy or move your existing game files from their current folder / directory location. Instead, future edits to that Project within CSIDE will directly overwrite those exact same scene files, just as if you had opened them with an ordinary text editor.

If you don't actually want CSIDE to edit those original files just yet, you can use CSIDE's Export function to immediately save a copy of the Project elsewhere (e.g. to a new folder under the default ChoiceScript Projects directory path mentioned above, perhaps), simply Close the original project, then import the Project from the new save location instead. The Export and Close options are available by right-clicking the Project header bar, or by selecting any file of that Project and clicking the folder icon at the very top of the screen.

## Setting Up


CSIDE has been designed to help and accommodate a variety of different users, from the least to the most experienced coders. To this end, you can adjust various configurable settings to suit your personal needs and preferences and tailor the application to your writing style.

The <a href="#" rel="cside" title="settings" onclick="CSIDE(parent.cside.selectTab.bind(null, 'settings'));">Settings</a> panel displays on the right of the screen in the Tabs section, and may be accessed at any time by clicking the corresponding button above. Changes made to the Settings take immediate effect and are automatically saved.

Your settings will persist between sessions and even future application updates (as long as you're using the same computer and copy of the application). We suggest you take a look through the settings early on in order to get a feel for what the application can do to accomodate to your personal tastes. It's like anything else, what works for us, won't necessarily work for you. Still, if you're unsure where to 
start, try taking the default settings for a spin. There's nothing stopping you from tweaking them over time until you're fully happy with CSIDE's appearance and functionality.

If you're a relative newcomer to either ChoiceScript or CSIDE, or even if you're simply in need of a refresh, in the <a href="#" rel="cside" title="examples" onclick="CSIDE(parent.cside.selectTab.bind(null, 'examples'));">Example Projects</a> Tab you'll find the Interactive CSIDE Tutorial. Itself written in ChoiceScript, the Tutorial will help guide you through the process of setting up your own Project (game) in CSIDE as well as explain, in step-by-step detail, everything you need to learn about the basics of ChoiceScript, in order to create your own Choice Game. You can also check out the [Further Reading](topics/further-reading.md "Further Reading") section for links to more useful guides, tutorials and more.

If you wish to make use of the Interactive CSIDE Tutorial, it will be necessary to first import it using the button available on that tab. This process enables you to create a specific new folder in which to place the Tutorial, at which point a new Project containing all the relevant scene files will also be automatically created for you within CSIDE. Once installed, click the 'Run this project' button on the Project header bar to launch the Tutorial itself.

## User Interface Overview

CSIDE provides a clean and intuitive interface, without clutter, and with every feature and function no more than a few clicks away.

On the left, one or more Game Projects each comprise a group of named Scene files related to that project. New projects can either be created from scratch or imported from your existing game files. Individual files can be moved or copied between different projects simply by dragging & dropping them, and the order of listing for projects - and for scene files within a Project - can be sorted by the same means.

Selecting a particular file displays its contents in the Code Editor to the right of the Projects listing. The Code Editor is a fully-functional text editor and also supports functionality such as automatic spell-checking (US or UK, plus a User Dictionary), handy code highlighting, multiple Hotkeys for ease of use, and a powerful 'Smart Indentation' function to streamline your game scripting.

On the right, a number of Tab panels enable one-click access to different features of the program, including Help documentation, various User Settings, Example Projects, and the all-important Game Tab panel for running, testing and fine-tuning a selected game Project during development.

Lurking in wait below the Code Editor is the CSIDE Console (click the >_ icon to open / close), a versatile monitoring and debugging tool which, among other things, works closely with the Game Tab panel to help you track down elusive bugs in your code.

...and that's just the tip of the iceberg! But don't worry about that too much, if anythings sounds daunting, ignore it, stick to the code editor and game tab for your first game. CSIDE has been designed from the ground up to be as equally helpful and unobtrusive as you need it to be, use what you feel comfortable with, and feel free to come back and try out other features at a later date. They won't get in your way!


### Usability Tips

CSIDE's user interface has been designed with todays widescreen monitors mind mind. However, for smaller screens, you can hide the Scenes and Projects (left) and Tab Topics (right) via their sliding panels. Just use the <-> buttons above the respective (top) corners of the Code Editor.

[**Desktop versions only**] Double-clicking the CSIDE main header bar toggles between your normal 
window size / position and Full Screen (Mac) or maximized (Windows) mode. For extended periods of intensive work, you may find it more comfortable to resize the CSIDE window and position it in the middle of your screen. You can hide the Tabs panel, the Scenes and Projects panel, or both while you're focusing on the editor window. Then, when you're ready to run a play-test game, or if you need to switch scenes or access the Help files, you can easily toggle back to Full Screen/maximized mode and slide open the relevant panel.

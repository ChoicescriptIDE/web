
## What is the ChoiceScript IDE?

CSIDE (or ChoiceScript Integrated Development Environment) is exactly that - an integrated development environment for the ChoiceScript scripting language.


### What does that mean?

Don't worry, it's not half as complicated as it sounds. Simply put, CSIDE is a piece of software (a computer application) that aims to provide you with all the tools and resources you need to easily develop Interactive Fiction games using the ChoiceScript scripting language. It provides a way to manage your files, write your stories and test your game scripting - all in one neat package! It comes bundled with a whole host of features and functions designed to streamline the entire process and take out every possible hardship or chore, leaving nothing but the fun bits to you.

From the very second your fingers first brush the keyboard to the moment you're finally ready to click 'Export' and publish that blockbuster game, CSIDE is here to help you, every step of the way.


### So I need to be a programmer to use this, huh?

Absolutely not! Most ChoiceScript authors have little or no programming experience, only a passion (and talent!) for writing great stories. CSIDE has been designed first and foremost with writers in mind, to make both learning - and using ChoiceScript - fun and easy to do.


### Really? I dunno...

If you're still uncertain, or perhaps aren't even sure what ChoiceScript is, check out the website of its creators, [Choice of Games LLC](https://www.choiceofgames.com), and maybe even play some of the Free Trials developed by people just like you using ChoiceScript. Once you've got your head around what it is and what they do - and how these games actually work - we're confident it'll all make a lot more sense!

Happy scripting!

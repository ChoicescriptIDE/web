## Stepping

The CSIDE Stepping function provides the facility to procedurally step-through your game's code, executing it a line at a time rather than an entire page all at once, and thereby allowing you to closely monitor and analyse everything your code is doing every step of the way. Together with the [Console](topics/console.md "Console") log display - designed primarily to keep you informed of variables changes as and when these occur behind the scenes - this partnership provides the most effective and efficient means of hunting down those annoyingly-elusive logic errors in your code.

The Stepping function is activated using the 'Start Stepping' button found at the top of the Game Tab panel - alongside the standard 'Show Stats' and 'Restart' buttons - when running a test game within CSIDE. Activating this function will toggle the button to 'Stop Stepping', while also revealing the adjacent 'Step' button with which you may now step through your code one line at a time. There is no limit to how many times you can toggle between 'Start Stepping' and 'Stop Stepping' during a single play-test run, allowing you to navigate through pages of narrative at the normal pace if required.

Whilst Stepping is active, the Code Editor window will switch scenes as needed to display the precise line of code being executed with each click of the 'Step' button, indicated by an arrow to the left of the display pointing at the actual current line number and adjusting accordingly with each click of the 'Step' button. The Code Editor will also attempt to load into CSIDE any closed scene files it needs to properly display the actual lines of code currently being stepped through.

It should be noted that while the Stepping function essentially slows the processing of your test game down to a controlled snail's pace, where required for careful analysis of your code, it doesn't change the fact that is is still very much "running" in the Game Tab panel. You will still be able to interact with the game in normal fashion as a player would, by choosing Options and clicking 'Next' as required to continue the game past those particular points.

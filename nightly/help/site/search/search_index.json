Thank you for providing us with a fresh, growing, and ever-improving selection of high-quality multiple choice games. Thank you for being champions of equality. And finally, thank you for creating ChoiceScript and supporting the growth of such a very special community.</p> <p>We would also like to thank that same community: the forum-goers, writers, editors, beta testers, and game-players, and even those of you who haven't joined us quite yet. Without you, the fans, there would be no games\u2014there would be no ChoiceScript. There would be no CSIDE. Thank you to all, past, present, and future supporters, pioneers of all that we do and stand for. It has been, and will continue to be, our pleasure to be a part of it all.</p> <p>Of course, no thank you list could ever be complete without mentioning 'The CSIDE Team'\u2014the only fitting name. Four years is a very long time to work alone on a side project of this magnitude, without pay, without a clear goal, and with no finish line in sight. Between life, work, and my studies, it would have been very easy to give up on this project, way back before it had barely even begun. It would have been simpler to leave it as that simple textbox on a website that you could paste some ChoiceScript code into.</p> <p>From the very beginning, from a featureless, bug-ridden experiment to a feature-full, (slightly less) buggy application, they saw the potential in CSIDE and carried it with me through the years\u2014through productive times and quiet times, hard times and easy times, the joy and the pain. In no particular order, by their Choice of Games forum handles:</p> <ul> <li>Vendetta</li> <li>Fiogan</li> <li>Nocturnal_Stillness</li> <li>fantom</li> <li>LordIrish</li> <li>Shockbolt</li> </ul> <p>Thank you all, for everything.</p> <p>To all the other beta-testers who weren't with us all the way, you know who you are, and you also have our heartfelt thanks for all the parts you played, big or small. There really isn't a single person, organisation, resource, or entity listed on this page that CSIDE, in its current form, could have existed without. It really wouldn't be half the program it is today without every last one of you.</p> <p>We hope you enjoy using CSIDE just as much as we did creating it.</p> <p>Happy scripting,</p> <p>The CSIDE Team!</p> Resources, Images, Code Libraries etc. <p>Node.js</p> <p>Electron</p> <p>electron-builder</p> <p>jQuery &amp; jQuery UI</p> <p>Knockout.js</p> <p>Knockout-JQuery UI</p> <p>noty</p> <p>Bootstrap</p> <p>Bootbox.js</p> <p>Mousetrap</p> <p>bootstrap contextmenu by sydcanem</p> <p>Monaco Editor</p> <p>Font Awesome</p> <p>marked</p> <p>nspell</p> <p>Inno Setup</p> <p>write-file-atomic</p> <p>UglifyJS</p> <p>mkdocs</p> <p>mkdocs-material</p> <p>mkdocs-localsearch</p> <p>uuid</p>"},{"location":"advanced-topics.html","title":"Advanced topics","text":""},{"location":"advanced-topics.html#c","title":"C","text":"<ul> <li>The Console</li> </ul>"},{"location":"advanced-topics.html#s","title":"S","text":"<ul> <li>Stepping</li> </ul>"},{"location":"basic-topics.html","title":"Basic topics","text":""},{"location":"basic-topics.html#c","title":"C","text":"<ul> <li>Code Editor</li> </ul>"},{"location":"basic-topics.html#i","title":"I","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Image Scenes</p> </li> <li> <p>Issues</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"basic-topics.html#p","title":"P","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Projects</p> </li> <li> <p>Project Options</p> </li> <li> <p>Publishing and Exporting</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"basic-topics.html#s","title":"S","text":"<ul> <li>Scenes</li> </ul>"},{"location":"basic-topics.html#q","title":"Q","text":"<ul> <li>Quicktest and Randomtest</li> </ul>"},{"location":"basic-topics.html#t","title":"T","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Tab Panels</p> </li> <li> <p>Testing and Debugging</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog.html","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"changelog.html#v131-21062019","title":"v1.3.1 - 21/06/2019","text":"<p>Hotfix release.

The list order for scenes or projects can be rearranged in the same way.</p> <p>Selecting a scene file displays its contents in the Code Editor, which is in the centre panel. The Code Editor is a fully functional text editor; it features automatic spell checking (US or UK, plus a User Dictionary), handy code highlighting, multiple hotkeys for ease of use, and a powerful Smart Indentation function to streamline your game scripting.</p> <p>The tabs in the rightmost panel give you one-click access to various program features. The first is the all-important Game Tab, for running, testing, and fine-tuning your project during game development. Then there are Issues, for debugging your game; User Settings, for personalising CSIDE for your use; Help and Information; the User Dictionary; and Example Projects and Templates, including templates with tutorials in ChoiceScript.</p> <p>Beneath the Code Editor is the CSIDE Console (click the &gt;_ icon to open/close), a versatile monitoring and debugging tool with a variety of uses. It works closely with the Game Tab panel to help you track down elusive bugs, or test and balance your code.</p> <p>And that's only the tip of the iceberg! But not to worry; CSIDE is designed from the ground up to be exactly as helpful and unobtrusive as you need it to be.

The current project and scene name will appear on the header bar at the top of the Editor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hotkeys: The Code Editor is a fully functional text editor with standard keyboard shortcuts enabled, for instance: undo, select, cut, paste, and more. A full list of keyboard shortcuts can be found here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resizing: Clicking the double arrow icons above the top two corners of the Code Editor window toggle the adjoining Scenes &amp; Projects Panel or Tab Panel open or closed. This enlarges the Editor window, allowing for more working space.</p> </li> <li> <p>Full Window: The ESC key (or F11) provides a handy 'full-window' on/off toggle for the Code Editor. This temporarily removes the Scenes &amp; Projects and Tab Panels and all headers from view. The Code Editor must be in focus (that is, with a blinking text cursor) in order to use the full-window toggle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Auto Line-Wrapping: When enabled in Settings, the Code Editor will automatically wrap longer lines, such as narrative paragraphs, to fit the display width of the editor. The line wrap will automatically adjust if the editor window is resized.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spellchecking: CSIDE offers US and UK dictionaries in Settings. Words underlined in red in the Code Editor window indicate that those words are not in the current dictionary nor the User Dictionary. Right-clicking on an underlined word presents a menu with options to choose an alternative spelling, ignore the spelling for the current session, or add the word to the User Dictionary.</p> <p>The User Dictionary is accessible through the Tabs Panel. It is possible to both manually add and remove words via the dictionary's interface. Any words added to the User Dictionary will not be underlined as misspellings in the Code Editor. For more information, please see the User Dictionary tab.</p> </li> <li> <p>Code Highlighting: The Code Editor incorporates automatic colour-coded highlighting of ChoiceScript commands. This highlighting helps distinguish between script and narrative at a glance; it also makes possible coding errors and typos immediately obvious. For instance, *page_break will change colour the instant the command is completed, but only when spelled correctly and recognised as a legitimate command. Each category of code\u2014#options, *set/{variable}, *goto/*label, and *comment\u2014is highlighted in a different colour for ease of differentiation.</p> <p>It is not possible to change the highlighting colours used, but they do vary according to the Dark, Light, or Dichromatic Code Editor themes (selectable in Settings).</p> </li> <li> <p>Command Help: When enabled under Settings, double-clicking a legitimate ChoiceScript command typed in the Code Editor (for instance, *choice) opens your default browser and automatically navigates to the Help page for that command on the ChoiceScriptDev Wikia. If your default browser is already running in the background, the Help page will load in a new tab.</p> </li> <li> <p>Text Formatting: ChoiceScript supports both bold and italic formatting, using start and end tags in the game files to mark formatted words or phrases. The CTRL-I and CTRL-B hotkeys (CMD-I and CMD-B) will wrap selected text with the formatting tags for italics and bold, respectively. If no text is currently selected, the hotkeys place the start and end tags on either side of the cursor. You can also quickly remove matching tags by repeating the same process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Displaying Variables in Narrative: Using CTRL-D/CMD-D wraps the selected text with the scripting to display a variable's value. If no text is currently selected, the hotkeys place the start and end braces on either side of the cursor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tab Indentation: Indentation in ChoiceScript uses either spaces or tabs. The default indentation can be changed in Settings. In addition when using spaces, pressing the TAB key will insert the correct number of spaces for a single indentation level (2, 4, 6, or 8). SHIFT-TAB will dedent by one level. TAB and SHIFT-TAB also work with selected blocks of text.</p> </li> <li> <p>Smart Indentation: This optional function streamlines game scripting by automatically indenting\u2014and where possible, also dedenting\u2014according to ChoiceScript's requirements. When Smart Indentation is active, the Code Editor will move the cursor to the correct indentation on each new line. Holding down SHIFT while pressing ENTER temporarily overrides Smart Indentation, placing the cursor at the very start of the next line.</p> <p>Although Smart Indentation is especially useful for new authors who are still learning ChoiceScript's indentation hierarchy, we encourage experienced ChoiceScript coders to give this function a try. It is our belief that most users can easily adjust to this simpler, more streamlined method of coding and, over time, will find it to be a distinct benefit for ease of coding and reduction of casual indentation errors.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"topics/code-editor.html#block-selection","title":"Block Selection","text":"<p>A number of Code Editor features work well when using Block Selection (i.e. when selecting multiple lines of code or narrative using the mouse or SHIFT-UP/DOWN).</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatic Word Count: When activated under Settings, the bar immediately below the Code Editor displays the word count of the selected block, or the word count of the entire scene if no text is selected.

The formatting will automatically exclude *command and #option lines, and then #option text can be individually formatted if desired.</p> </li> <li> <p>Block Indent/Dedent: The TAB/SHIFT-TAB keys automatically indent or dedent all selected text by one level.</p> </li> <li> <p>Block Move: CTRL-SHIFT-UP/DOWN moves an entire block of text up or down by one line at a time. This essentially achieves the same effect as cutting and pasting, but it allows for more fluid and efficient local editing, especially when used in combination with block indent/dedent.</p> </li> <li> <p>Block Comment: Toggles selected text to or from *comment mode by adding *comment at the beginning of each selected line. Right-click in the numbered line area of the Code Editor and select 'Toggle Block Comment' to use. This is especially useful for testing, debugging, and publishing purposes; it's a quick and simple way to temporarily disable an entire block of code prior to running a game test. It can also be useful for hiding in-progress material when sharing beta versions of the game.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stats Listing: Typing a list of variable names, selecting them all, and hitting CTRL-D/CMD-D will wrap each individual variable name with the scripting to display its value, while ignoring any command lines (e.g. *line_break) included in the selection block.

Most of the time, locating and identify scripting bugs is a fairly straightforward task.</p> <p>The 'logic error' or 'game design bug' can be more elusive. Logic errors cause a game to behave strangely in a certain location, often only under particular circumstances, but they do not result in an actual game crash. This can make it much harder to isolate and understand the cause of the error, never mind fix it.</p> <p>Logic errors can be caused by a typo or oversight in otherwise valid syntax, such as using a 'greater than' operator instead of a 'lesser than', or using 'and' instead of 'or' between two conditions. Logic errors are often related to the current value of a variable referenced at the exact point in the game where the bug occurs.</p> <p>The basic idea behind the CSIDE Console tracking system is to allow you to monitor changes of specific variable values as you progress through your game. If you do find a game design bug, you can closely investigate what's happening to the variables behind the scenes, right up to that point in the game. Monitoring variable changes at every step of the way will help you find the faulty logic behind the bug.</p>"},{"location":"topics/console.html#general-functionality","title":"General Functionality","text":"<p>In addition to tracking commands and variables, the Console also supports a range of additional features. You can obtain variable values, change them either directly or by using operators, and even jump to a different scene or label. Think of the Console as a textual way to directly interact with your game 'behind the scenes' in real time, as you play through it a page at a time.</p> <p>If you type a variable name into the Console, it returns the current value of that variable at this precise point in your play-test. This includes the values of 'hidden' variables not displayed on the stat screen. You can even use *set to overwrite or modify that value in your active game before continuing with your play-test, allowing you to avoid inconvenient restarts or experiment with variable values. The Console also supports *goto and *goto_scene to 'jump' your running play-test game to a specific point for easy, quick testing.</p> <p>Anything you put into the Console command line will not affect the actual scripting in your scene files. Using *set, *temp, *goto, and *rand will only change the temporary data being held in memory for the current running game, purely for play-testing and bug-hunting purposes.</p> <p>As you play-test your game, the Console logs entries relating to variable creation and changes in variable values. You control what the Console will log by entering instructions into the Console command line, at the bottom of the Console window. When the Console is closed, a small red indicator appears beside the icon as new entries are logged in the Console's display.</p> <p>Note: If you make any changes to your game files, you must run the game again before those changes are reflected in the Console, even if the changes have been saved.</p> <p>Reading the Logs: All variables created in the startup file are prefixed with 'stats'. Temp variables are prefixed with 'temps'. The name and line number of each value change is also logged for ease of reference.</p> <p>General Console Commands: The Console will accept and log any correct command; an invalid command will return an error message. The command line buffers recent entries, so mistyped commands can be quickly corrected by pressing UP, making the necessary correction, and then pressing ENTER. Recent commands can be quickly cycled through by using UP/DOWN, allowing easy re-entry of common commands.</p> <p>Using the *console_ Command in Game Files: For purposes of thorough repeat testing, you can also insert certain *console_ commands directly into your game's scene files. See below under 'Console Commands in Scene Files' for details.</p> <p>Note: Commands entered into the Console only impact the main game running in the Game Tab Panel. The Console does not affect a game running in Popout.

For example, if you are missing a simple *goto command for one #option and receive an 'illegally fall out of a choice' statement, that error is only detected when the code hits a line containing something other than the expected *goto.</p> <p>In essence, if you cannot find an obvious error on the indicated line, check the section above that line (or below too, if the code is part of a loop section!) for errors such as a missing *goto, incorrect indentation, etc..

You can run Quicktest and Randomtest within CSIDE by right-clicking on the project header bar and selecting Test Project. If there is a detectable bug, the test identifies the type of bug, and the scene file and line number where the problem occurs.</p> <p>During a play test, readers play through your work and give feedback on continuity errors, typos, any bugs that might still be left after Quicktest and Randomtest, and any other problems or issues they encounter. You can also play-test the game yourself within CSIDE; actually, doing this before you let anyone else see it is probably a good idea!</p> <p>CSIDE makes the play-test process easy and extra efficient, in part through Issues, its built-in tracking error. If the game crashes while playtesting, CSIDE logs the error as an 'Issue' and will attempt to give you the type and line number of the error.</p>"},{"location":"topics/testing-and-debugging.html#debugging-fixing-bugs","title":"Debugging (Fixing Bugs)","text":"<p>So there's a bug in your game. What happens next? Do you give up? No, of course not; it's time to fix it! Squashing those pesky little bugs is a process called 'debugging'.</p> <p>Once you know there's a bug, the next step is figuring out the cause. Debugging tools help you locate and isolate the source of any bugs.</p> <p>Methods of debugging include:</p> <ul> <li>Looking through your code</li> <li>Addressing any Issues logged by CSIDE</li> <li>Using the automated tests</li> <li>Using the CSIDE Console while running a test game</li> <li>Recruiting testers to help isolate exactly when and why a bug occurs</li> </ul> <p>It's important to note that testing and debugging are not necessarily separate or exclusive parts of designing your ChoiceScript game. In fact, most methods for debugging help you both find and fix bugs.</p> <p>Of course, debugging sometimes reveals (or even introduces) more bugs. CSIDE Issues, Quicktest, and Randomtest can help you periodically fix bugs; you can address error reports one at a time until you have a working game. Play-testers, on the other hand, can point out continuity or scripting errors that are not game-breaking, or they can play through specific sections to isolate a known bug.</p> <p>Some of the debugging tools, such as the CSIDE Console, are exceptionally helpful if the error is logical in nature; logic errors can be hard to find when hunting directly through the code. A logic error might include a bug that makes your game behave strangely in particular situations but doesn't necessarily cause it to crash, or a bug where the initial error is located in a different part of the scripting to the actual crash.</p> <p>It's extremely important to test your game as you go, after each section or even after each day's work. Making sure your game is bug-free on a regular basis (or as close to bug-free as humanly possible!) makes testing and debugging simpler and quicker in the long run. (Plus, there's that nice warm fuzzy feeling when you can play all the way through your game without encountering any game-breaking problems.)</p>"},{"location":"topics/testing-and-debugging.html#further-reading-tools-of-the-trade","title":"Further Reading: Tools of the Trade","text":"<p>Now that you have a general idea of what testing and debugging is all about, here are some links to more in-depth topics.

     * Shortens the paths but keeps them easy to distinguish.
     * Replaces not important parts with ellipsis.
     * Every shorten path matches only one original path and vice versa.
     *
     * Algorithm for shortening paths is as follows:
     * 1. For every path in list, find unique substring of that path.
     * 2. Unique substring along with ellipsis is shortened path of that path.
     * 3. To find unique substring of path, consider every segment of length from 1 to path.length of path from end of string
     *    and if present segment is not substring to any other paths then present segment is unique path,
     *    else check if it is not present as suffix of any other path and present segment is suffix of path itself,
     *    if it is true take present segment as unique path.
     * 4. Apply ellipsis to unique segment according to whether segment is present at start/in-between/end of path.
     *
     * Example 1
     * 1. consider 2 paths i.e. ['a\\b\\c\\d', 'a\\f\\b\\c\\d']
     * 2. find unique path of first path,
     * 	a. 'd' is present in path2 and is suffix of path2, hence not unique of present path.
     * 	b. 'c' is present in path2 and 'c' is not suffix of present path, similarly for 'b' and 'a' also.
     * 	c. 'd\\c' is suffix of path2.
     *  d. 'b\\c' is not suffix of present path.
     *  e. 'a\\b' is not present in path2, hence unique path is 'a\\b...'.
     * 3. for path2, 'f' is not present in path1 hence unique is '...\\f\\...'.
     *
     * Example 2
     * 1. consider 2 paths i.e. ['a\\b', 'a\\b\\c'].
     * 	a. Even if 'b' is present in path2, as 'b' is suffix of path1 and is not suffix of path2, unique path will be '...\\b'.
     * 2. for path2, 'c' is not present in path1 hence unique path is '..\\c'.
